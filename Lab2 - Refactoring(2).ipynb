    "- **Player Type Selection**: Allow players to choose their character type. Set attributes based on the choice (e.g., wizard: magic = 10, knight: magic = 0).\n",
    "- **Inventory Display**: Implement a function to show the player's inventory.\n",
    "- **Item Details**: Write a function to provide detailed information about an inventory item (e.g., Knife: \"forged in the depths of Polymar\", +5 magic, edged weapon, one-handed).\n",
    "  - Bonus: Calculate bonuses when equipping and unequipping items.\n",
    "- **Inventory Management**: Create functions to add and remove items from the inventory.\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Ensure the game can save and reload the player's character using files.\n",

    "- **Player Profile**: Include player stats.\n",
    "- **Inventory System**: Implement a bag to hold items.\n",
    "- **Items**: Include 10 items, each with a description and trait (e.g., +5 magic).\n",
    "- **Concepts**: Utilize functions, loops, arrays, classes, and constants. You may also use files and structs if desired.\n",
    "- **Player Type Selection**: Allow players to choose their character type and set attributes accordingly (e.g., wizard: magic = 10, knight: magic = 0).\n",
    "- **Inventory Display**: Implement a function to show the player's inventory.\n",
    "- **Code Quality**: Keep your code clean and consider various player needs, as this project will be handed off to a partner for further development.\n",
